# Omnia Radix

![Logo](logo/Banner%20energy%20red@2x.png)

This repository is the umbrella for Omnia Radix with issue tracking and feature requests and pointers to other resources.

Radix is [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/)'s Platform-as-a-Service that offers testing, building, deploying, running and monitoring of software. Its goal is to automate "the boring stuff" and let developers focus on business logic and features and offloading much of the tooling and automation to Radix.


## Getting started

Head to the [public website](https://www.radix.equinor.com/) and check the guides and docs. When you are ready, you can register your application in the [Radix Web Console](https://console.radix.equinor.com) â€” provided you have an Equinor account ðŸ˜€.

## Help!

Contact us on Equinor Slack on [#omnia_radix_support](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CBKM6N2JY/). We are also available on [#omnia_radix](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/C8U7XGGAJ/) for general inquires.

Bugs and feature requests can be submitted using the [issue tracker in this repo](https://github.com/equinor/radix/issues). If you are external to Equinor, the issue tracker is for now the best way to get in touch, too.

## Documentation

We are moving fast and making changes, so portions of the documentation will be outdated at any time. Stable documentation is a work in progress.
